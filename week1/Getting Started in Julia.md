Getting Started in Julia
=====================

Open _Julia_ by finding the application and running it.  This will open up a window in which you can type in commands to Julia and get responses.  Once we  learn the basics of Julia, then we'll learn about interactive Julia notebooks.

Command line Julia

When this open, you will get a prompt denoted by `julia>`. For example, type `4+4` and  you will get the result `8`.  Here's a list of the standard mathematical operations that Julia knows: +,-,*,/,^ (power) as well a large number of functions including: exp (natural exponential);  log (natural log); the trig functions sin, cos, tan, csc, sec, cot; the inverse trig functions asin, acos, atan, acsc, asec, acot.
