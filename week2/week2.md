Newton's Method
------------

Solving an equation is a very important part of mathematics and other scientific fields.  However, finding general solutions to equations is not very easy.  Consider a cubic equation like \\( cubic \\).    In the spirit of (but not very simple) the quadratic formula, there is a [cubic formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_function#Roots_of_a_cubic_function).  Much of the wikipedia page spends time solving the cubic with all possibilities.  In short, it's not very easy. 

In lieu of using such a formula, a more robust approach is to solve it numerically.  Let's consider


\\[15{x}^{3}-143{x}^2+226x+280=0\\]

This cubic actually factors, but finding those factors is quite difficult to do in general.  We then look at using [Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) to solve this.
